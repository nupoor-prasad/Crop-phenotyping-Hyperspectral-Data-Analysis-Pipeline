# Hyperspectral-Data-Analysis for Crop-phenotyping-Pipeline
In-Field Crop Phenotyping Using Hyperspectral Imaging for detection of optimum harvest time.
This repository contains the codebase for hyperspectral image processing pipeline for extraction of plant area as well as generation and evaluation of vegetation indices (HVI). For statistical analysis the R pipeline calculates relevant descriptive statistics, conducts one-way ANOVA, performs Pearson correlation test, Principal component analysis and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis to find potential predictors (HVI) of crop biophysical traits.
